## Lab/Practicals Syllabus:

For practical Labs for Machine Learning, students may use softwares like MABLAB/Octave or Python. For later exercises, students can create/use their own datasets or utilize datasets from online repositories like UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).

1. Perform basic operations on matrices (like addition, subtraction, multiplication) and display specific rows or columns of the matrix.
2. Perform other matrix operations like converting matrix data to absolute values, taking the negative of matrix values, additing/removing rows/columns from a matrix, finding the
       
maximum or minimum values in a matrix or in a row/column, and finding the sum of some/all
elements in a matrix.
3. Create various type of plots/charts like histograms, plot based on sine/cosine function based
on data from a matrix. Further label different axes in a plot and data in a plot.
4. Perform vectorized implementation of simple matrix operation like finding the transpose of a
matrix, adding, subtracting or multiplying two matrices.
5. Implement Linear Regression problem. For example, based on a dataset comprising of
existing set of prices and area/size of the houses, predict the estimated price of a given
house.
6. Based on multiple features/variables perform Linear Regression. For example, based on a
number of additional features like number of bedrooms, servant room, number of balconies,
number of houses of years a house has been built – predict the price of a house.
7. Implement a classification/ logistic regression problem. For example based on different features of students data, classify, whether a student is suitable for a particular activity.
Based on the available dataset, a student can also implement another classification problem
like checking whether an email is spam or not.
8. Use some function for regularization of dataset based on problem 7.
9. Use some function for neural networks, like Stochastic Gradient Descent or backpropagation -
algorithm to predict the value of a variable based on the dataset of problem 14.
10. Implement and evaluate a classification using Naïve Bayes. For example based on different
features of students data, classify, whether a student is suitable for a particular activity. Based on the available dataset, a student can also implement another classification problem like checking whether an email is spam or not.
11. Implement and evaluate a classification using SVM. For example based on different features of students data, classify, whether a student is suitable for a particular activity. Based on the

available dataset, a student can also implement another classification problem like checking
whether an email is spam or not.
12. Implement and evaluate a classification using Decision Tree.
13. Implement and evaluate a Clustering using K-means algorithm.
14. Implement and evaluate a classification for an imbalance dataset
15. Implement and evaluate a classification using Random forest
